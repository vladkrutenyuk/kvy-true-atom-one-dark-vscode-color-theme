# Kvy-True Atom One Dark

## My (kvy) version of atom one color theme

### it's primarily for JavsSript/TypeScript/React

(so i dont know how it will be on another)

I like Atom One Dark color palette, but don't like scopes in themes i found on marketplace. So I've mixed Dark+ default theme with Atom One Dark color and also I've added some additional rules and scopes for syntax highlighting.
